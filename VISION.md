## QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

Before you start coding, ask yourself:

1. **Who is your user?** (Individual, team, enterprise?)
2. **What's the core value?** (Productivity, collab, AI, ecosystem?)
3. **How will you monetize?** (Freemium, subscription, enterprise?)
4. **What's your timeline?** (MVP in 1 month, full platform in 1 year?)
5. **Do you have co-founders?** (Split work or do it alone?)
6. **What's your competitive edge?** (Speed, UX, price, features?)

Answers to these will help you pick the right path.

## FINAL THOUGHTS

You've built something cool. A real OS-like interface is impressive and rare.

Now comes the hard part: **deciding what to build next.**

Don't build everything. Pick ONE path and go deep. Execute ruthlessly.

The best product is the one that gets shipped and used by real people.

Start with quick wins to build momentum. Then pick your path.

**You got this! 🚀**
